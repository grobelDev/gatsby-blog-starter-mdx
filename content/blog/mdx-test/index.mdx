This is a post showing MDX in action. This starter now comes with MDX out-of-the-box!

<TestButton></TestButton>

## MDX lets you write JSX embedded inside markdown, perfect for technical blogs.

MDX works with Gatsby through [gatsby-plugin-mdx](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-mdx/).
You can learn more about it in the Gatsby docs: [Getting Started with MDX](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/mdx/getting-started/).
